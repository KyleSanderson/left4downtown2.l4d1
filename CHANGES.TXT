Source Changes:

* Makefile (hl2sdk-l4d2, mmsource-central, sourcemod-1-3, vstdlib_linux.so and tier0_linux.so)
* Makefile (mkdir detours/codepatch/sdk)
* player_slots.cpp (comment out jz patch, move GameConf->GetMemSig (ConnectClientLobbyCheck) to PatchSlotCheckOnly())
* natives.cpp (zero out scoreA/B, prevent crash.)
* extension.h (enable DEBUG.)
* extension.cpp (GameFolderName = left4dead2.)
* detours/clear_team_scores.cpp (Including bool parameter.)
* detours/clear_team_scores.h (typedef including bool.)
* gamedata/left4downtown.txt (Sigs/Offsets changed.)
* scripting/l4d2_unreservelobby.sp (for testing lobby reservation removal.)

Working:

1) Unlocked player slots (Max: 18) - Working for Ingame & Server Browser.
2) Detours/Spawn & Campaign Natives working (Exception: L4D_GetCampaignScores)
3) Unreserve is working - Use included l4d2_unreserve.smx/sp

Known Issues:

1) Campaign scores in versus are not being reset if a new versus campaign is chosen while in game (Appears to be Valve Bug)
2) L4D_GetCampaignScores currently does not work due to offset changes (asm is very different - probably to reflect new Scavenge Mode)
3) When unreserved lobby reports that user is not in a joinable game. This was apparent in L4D1.
4) MaxUsers in Group Server Lobby (No doubt the cause for no steam group joins > 8 Users) - UPDATE: FOUND (in development)

I have identified the Steam Group/Lobby Max players problem - this has been moved to the matchmaking_ds_linux binary.
Unfortunately at present Sourcemod does not have the ability to read signatures beyond engine & server libraries, thus being
the reason this cannot be fixed easily. (This is currently being looked into where time permits)

Remember this is BETA, and currently only supports Left 4 Dead 2.
